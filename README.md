## How to create a race
You need the latest [Map Editor](https://github.com/oldnapalm/MapEditor/releases/latest) mod installed alongside this mod. Press **F7**, go to **Create Map for External Mod**, and then **Create a Community Race**. Then follow the next steps:
1. Place a ped - this will be your race trigger/marker.
2. Place vehicles - these will be the race spawnpoints. Spawning different vehicle models adds them to the vehicle model pool.
3. Place markers in order for your checkpoints. The type of marker doesn't matter. Don't place markers right at a curve, because the AI doesn't have time to react and will drive right past the curve.
4. Place any objects you want, they'll be spawned in the race.
5. Save the map, it should be saved in `Scripts\Races\yourmap.xml`
6. Open `yourmap.xml` with a text editor and edit the `Name` and `Description` tags.
7. You're done! Restart the mod to play your race.
